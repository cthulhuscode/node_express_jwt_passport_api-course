# Password recovery

A new endpoint was created to handle the password recovery.

The followed steps to achieve this functionality were:

- Get the user email and look for it in the database.
- Create a jwt token with userId as payload.
- Save the token in the database. We created a new column in the Users table called recoveryToken. We'll use it to compare that the token we receive from the user is valid.
- Generate and send by email an url with the token as query params, like this:
  `http://localhost:3000/recovery?token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9`
- User sends through body the new password along with the token that was sent to him by email in the previous step.
- Verify token an get payload.
- Get the userId from payload and look for the user in the database.
- Compare the token passed with the one stored in the database.
- If everything goes well, finally encrypt new password, store it in the database and remove recoveryToken from the database.
